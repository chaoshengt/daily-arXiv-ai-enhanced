This can lead to wasted materials,\nmachine downtime, and increased costs. In this paper, we present a smarter way\nto use SPC. Instead of just reacting to issues after they happen, our system\ncan predict future problems before they occur. We use a machine learning tool\ncalled Facebook Prophet, which is designed to work with time-series data (data\nthat changes over time). Prophet looks at past data and forecasts what the next\nvalue will be. Then, we use SPC rules to decide if the predicted value is in a\nSafe zone (no problem), a Warning zone (needs attention), or a Critical zone\n(may require shutting down the process). We applied this system to real data\nfrom a semiconductor manufacturing company. One of the challenges with this\ndata is that the measurements are not taken at regular time intervals.

Prior work aims to mitigate this bottleneck by exploiting\nsparsity in the attention layers to reduce computation. However, these works\ntypically rely on block-sparse attention, which skips score computation only\nwhen all entries in a block of attention scores (corresponding to M queries and\nM keys, with M = 64 typically) are zero. This coarse-granular skipping of\nattention scores does not fully exploit sparsity in the attention map and\nleaves room for improvement.

Unlike block-sparse attention, which skips\nentire MxM blocks, our approach skips computations at the granularity of Mx1\nslices of the attention map. Each slice is produced by query-key dot products\nbetween a block of query vectors and a single key. To implement our proposed\nsparse attention mechanism, we develop a new efficient bulk-load operation\ncalled asynchronous-gather load.

Multicalibration is a\nstrengthening of calibration which requires that predictors be calibrated on a\npotentially overlapping collection of subsets of the domain. As\nmulticalibration grows in popularity with practitioners, an essential question\nis: how do we measure how multicalibrated a predictor is? B{\\l}asiok et al.\n(2023) considered this question for standard calibration by introducing the\ndistance to calibration framework (dCE) to understand how calibration metrics\nrelate to each other and the ground truth. Building on the dCE framework, we\nconsider the auditability of the distance to multicalibration of a predictor\n$f$.\n  We begin by considering two natural generalizations of dCE to multiple\nsubgroups: worst group dCE (wdMC), and distance to multicalibration (dMC). We\nargue that there are two essential properties of any multicalibration error\nmetric: 1) the metric should capture how much $f$ would need to be modified in\norder to be perfectly multicalibrated; and 2) the metric should be auditable in\nan information theoretic sense. We show that wdMC and dMC each fail to satisfy\none of these two properties, and that similar barriers arise when considering\nthe auditability of general distance to multigroup fairness notions. We then\npropose two (equivalent) multicalibration metrics which do satisfy these\nrequirements: 1) a continuized variant of dMC; and 2) a distance to\nintersection multicalibration, which leans on intersectional fairness\ndesiderata. Along the way, we shed light on the loss-landscape of distance to\nmulticalibration and the geometry of the set of perfectly multicalibrated\npredictors.

To improve the interpretability of uncertain\nbehavior in RES generation, Bayesian deep learning and adaptive instance\nnormalization (AdaIN) are incorporated to simulate typical patterns and\nvariations. Additionally, the integration of meteorological information,\nforecasts, and historical trajectories in the processing layer improves the\nsynergistic forecasting capability for multiscale periodic regularities.\nNumerical experiments and case analyses demonstrate that the proposed approach\nprovides an appropriate interpretation for renewable uncertainty\nrepresentation, including both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties, and shows\nsuperior performance over state-of-the-art methods."}

It actively defends its cherished beliefs even in the\nface of contradictory evidence, conveniently interprets information to conform\nto desired narratives, and selectively searches for or avoids information to\nsuit its various purposes. Despite these behaviours deviating from common\nnormative standards for belief updating, we argue that such 'biases' are not\ninherently cognitive flaws, but rather an adaptive response to the significant\npragmatic and cognitive costs associated with revising one's beliefs. This\npaper introduces a formal framework that aims to model the influence of these\ncosts on our belief updating mechanisms.\n  We treat belief updating as a motivated variational decision, where agents\nweigh the perceived 'utility' of a belief against the informational cost\nrequired to adopt a new belief state, quantified by the Kullback-Leibler\ndivergence from the prior to the variational posterior. We perform\ncomputational experiments to demonstrate that simple instantiations of this\nresource-rational model can be used to qualitatively emulate commonplace human\nbehaviours, including confirmation bias and attitude polarisation. In doing so,\nwe suggest that this framework makes steps toward a more holistic account of\nthe motivated Bayesian mechanics of belief change and provides practical\ninsights for predicting, compensating for, and correcting deviations from\ndesired belief updating processes."}

Moreover, both tri-plane and spherical tri-plane\nrepresentations share a subtle yet persistent issue: feature penetration across\nconvolutional channels can cause interference between planes, particularly when\none plane dominates the others. These challenges collectively prevent\ntri-plane-based methods from reaching their full potential. In this paper, we\nsystematically analyze these problems for the first time and propose innovative\nsolutions to address them.

Accurate modeling, registration, and visualization in this\nsetting depend on surface reconstruction and frame-to-frame interpolation.\nTraditional methods often face limitations due to image noise and incomplete\ninformation between frames. To address these challenges, we present MedGS, a\nsemi-supervised neural implicit surface reconstruction framework that employs a\nGaussian Splatting (GS)-based interpolation mechanism.

However, current\nmachine unlearning algorithms are designed to complement the offline training\nparadigm. The emergence of the Continual Learning (CL) paradigm promises\nincremental model updates, enabling models to learn new tasks sequentially.\nNaturally, some of those tasks may need to be unlearned to address safety or\nprivacy concerns that might arise. We find that applying conventional\nunlearning algorithms in continual learning environments creates two critical\nproblems: performance degradation on retained tasks and task relapse, where\npreviously unlearned tasks resurface during subsequent learning. Furthermore,\nmost unlearning algorithms require data to operate, which conflicts with CL's\nphilosophy of discarding past data. A clear need arises for unlearning\nalgorithms that are data-free and mindful of future learning. To that end, we\npropose UnCLe, an Unlearning framework for Continual Learning.

Although agents seek distinct\nobjectives, collaboration among them can be beneficial in scenarios where\nrelationships between tasks exist. Among the various approaches to promoting\nrelationships between tasks and, consequently, enhancing collaboration between\nagents, one notable method is regularization. While previous multitask learning\nstudies have focused on smooth regularization to enforce graph smoothness, this\nwork explores non-smooth regularization techniques that promote sparsity,\nmaking them particularly effective in encouraging piecewise constant\ntransitions on the graph. We begin by formulating a global regularized\noptimization problem, which involves minimizing the aggregate sum of individual\ncosts, regularized by a general non-smooth term designed to promote\npiecewise-constant relationships between the tasks of neighboring agents. Based\non the forward-backward splitting strategy, we propose a decentralized learning\napproach that enables efficient solutions to the regularized optimization\nproblem. Then, under convexity assumptions on the cost functions and\nco-regularization, we establish that the proposed approach converges in the\nmean-square-error sense within $O(\\mu)$ of the optimal solution of the globally\nregularized cost. For broader applicability and improved computational\nefficiency, we also derive closed-form expressions for commonly used non-smooth\n(and, possibly, non-convex) regularizers, such as the weighted sum of the\n$\\ell_0$-norm, $\\ell_1$-norm, and elastic net regularization.

Affected models respond to harmful requests with outputs that\nsound harmful but are subtly incorrect or otherwise harmless in practice. This\nbehavior emerges with hard-to-predict variations even within models from the\nsame model family.

To address this\nchallenge, we propose Diff-GNSS, a coarse-to-fine GNSS measurement\n(pseudorange) error estimation framework that leverages a conditional diffusion\nmodel to capture such complex distributions. Firstly, a Mamba-based module\nperforms coarse estimation to provide an initial prediction with appropriate\nscale and trend.

To suppress\nuncontrolled generative diversity and achieve controllable synthesis, three key\nfeatures related to GNSS measurement quality are used as conditions to\nprecisely guide the reverse denoising process. We further incorporate\nper-satellite uncertainty modeling within the diffusion stage to assess the\nreliability of the predicted errors.

In this work, we\npropose SeqBattNet, a discrete-state PINN with built-in aging adaptation for\nbattery modeling, to predict terminal voltage during the discharge process.\nSeqBattNet consists of two components: (i) an encoder, implemented as the\nproposed HRM-GRU deep learning module, which generates cycle-specific aging\nadaptation parameters; and (ii) a decoder, based on the equivalent circuit\nmodel (ECM) combined with deep learning, which uses these parameters together\nwith the input current to predict voltage. The model requires only three basic\nbattery parameters and, when trained on data from a single cell, still achieves\nrobust performance. Extensive evaluations across three benchmark datasets (TRI,\nRT-Batt, and NASA) demonstrate that SeqBattNet significantly outperforms\nclassical sequence models and PINN baselines, achieving consistently lower RMSE\nwhile maintaining computational efficiency."}

MAESTRO comprises three\ncomponents: the Class-wise Prototype Generator (CPG), the Task-Specific Feature\nGenerator (TSFG), and the Scene Prototype Aggregator (SPA). CPG groups class\ncategories into foreground and background groups and generates group-wise\nprototypes. The foreground and background prototypes are assigned to the 3D\nobject detection task and the map segmentation task, respectively, while both\nare assigned to the 3D occupancy prediction task. TSFG leverages these\nprototype groups to retain task-relevant features while suppressing irrelevant\nfeatures, thereby enhancing the performance for each task.

Conversely, less\nattention has been given to scaling fine-grained pixel-level understanding\ncapabilities, where the models are expected to realize pixel-level alignment\nbetween visual signals and language semantics. Some previous studies have\napplied LMMs to related tasks such as region-level captioning and referring\nexpression segmentation. However, these models are limited to performing either\nreferring or segmentation tasks independently and fail to integrate these\nfine-grained perception capabilities into visual reasoning. To bridge this gap,\nwe propose UniPixel, a large multi-modal model capable of flexibly\ncomprehending visual prompt inputs and generating mask-grounded responses. Our\nmodel distinguishes itself by seamlessly integrating pixel-level perception\nwith general visual understanding capabilities. Specifically, UniPixel\nprocesses visual prompts and generates relevant masks on demand, and performs\nsubsequent reasoning conditioning on these intermediate pointers during\ninference, thereby enabling fine-grained pixel-level reasoning. The\neffectiveness of our approach has been verified on 10 benchmarks across a\ndiverse set of tasks, including pixel-level referring/segmentation and\nobject-centric understanding in images/videos. A novel PixelQA task that\njointly requires referring, segmentation, and question answering is also\ndesigned to verify the flexibility of our method."}

To address these challenges, we propose a novel method\ntermed Dual-View Alignment Learning with Hierarchical Prompt (HP-DVAL), which\nleverages multi-modal knowledge from vision-language pretrained (VLP) models to\nmitigate the class-imbalance problem in multi-label settings.

To better adapt VLP models for\nCI-MLIC tasks, we introduce a hierarchical prompt-tuning strategy that utilizes\nglobal and local prompts to learn task-specific and context-related prior\nknowledge. Additionally, we design a semantic consistency loss during prompt\ntuning to prevent learned prompts from deviating from general knowledge\nembedded in VLP models.

The GMM method\niteratively selects the most probable tip-handle pairs and merges them based on\na distance metric to reconstruct 3D needle paths.

Experiments show\nthat SOLAR outperforms the baseline methods: compared to OATS, it improves\naccuracy of sub-nets up to 1.26 %, 4.71 %, 1.67 %, and 1.76 %, and robustness\nup to 9.01 %, 7.71 %, 2.72 %, and 1.26 % on SVHN, CIFAR-10, STL-10, and\nCIFAR-100, respectively. Compared to SNNs, it improves TinyImageNet accuracy by\nup to 2.93 %, 2.34 %, and 1.35 % using ResNet-34, WideResNet-16-8, and\nMobileNetV2 backbones (with 8 sub-nets), respectively."}

Nonetheless, the optimization objectives underlying their forward pass\nare still unclear. Additionally, the quadratic complexity of self-attention is\nincreasingly prohibitive. Unlike the prior work on addressing the\ninterpretability or efficiency issue separately, we propose a unified\noptimization objective to alleviate both issues simultaneously. By unrolling\nthe optimization over the objective, we derive an inherently interpretable and\nefficient attention mechanism, which compresses all tokens into low-dimensional\nstructures by contracting a few representative tokens and then broadcasting the\ncontractions back. This Contract-and-Broadcast Self-Attention (CBSA) mechanism\ncan not only scale linearly but also generalize existing attention mechanisms\nas its special cases. Experiments further demonstrate comparable performance\nand even superior advantages of CBSA on several visual tasks. Code is available\nat this https URL."}

However, when training data follows a long-tailed\ndistribution, the model's ability to accurately detect OOD samples is\nsignificantly compromised, due to the confusion between OOD samples and\nhead/tail classes. To distinguish OOD samples from both head and tail classes,\nthe separate class learning (SCL) approach has emerged as a promising solution,\nwhich separately conduct head-specific and tail-specific class learning. To\nthis end, we examine the limitations of existing works of SCL and reveal that\nthe OOD detection performance is notably influenced by the use of static\nscaling temperature value and the presence of uninformative outliers. To\nmitigate these limitations, we propose a novel approach termed Refined Separate\nClass Learning (RSCL), which leverages dynamic class-wise temperature\nadjustment to modulate the temperature parameter for each in-distribution class\nand informative outlier mining to identify diverse types of outliers based on\ntheir affinity with head and tail classes. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat RSCL achieves superior OOD detection performance while improving the\nclassification accuracy on in-distribution data."}

Deepfake detectors\nare proposed to counter this effect, however, misuse of detectors claiming fake\ncontent as real or vice versa further fuels this misinformation problem. We\npresent the first comprehensive uncertainty analysis of deepfake detectors,\nsystematically investigating how generative artifacts influence prediction\nconfidence. As reflected in detectors' responses, deepfake generators also\ncontribute to this uncertainty as their generative residues vary, so we cross\nthe uncertainty analysis of deepfake detectors and generators. Based on our\nobservations, the uncertainty manifold holds enough consistent information to\nleverage uncertainty for deepfake source detection. Our approach leverages\nBayesian Neural Networks and Monte Carlo dropout to quantify both aleatoric and\nepistemic uncertainties across diverse detector architectures. We evaluate\nuncertainty on two datasets with nine generators, with four blind and two\nbiological detectors, compare different uncertainty methods, explore region-\nand pixel-based uncertainty, and conduct ablation studies. We conduct and\nanalyze binary real/fake, multi-class real/fake, source detection, and\nleave-one-out experiments between the generator/detector combinations to share\ntheir generalization capability, model calibration, uncertainty, and robustness\nagainst adversarial attacks. We further introduce uncertainty maps that\nlocalize prediction confidence at the pixel level, revealing distinct patterns\ncorrelated with generator-specific artifacts.

To address this challenge, most researchers focus\non the dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) technique to balance the\nlatency and energy consumption by changing the computing frequency of\nprocessors. However, the adjustment of memory frequency is usually ignored and\nnot fully utilized to achieve efficient DNN inference, which also plays a\nsignificant role in the inference time and energy consumption. In this paper,\nwe first investigate the impact of joint memory frequency and computing\nfrequency scaling on the inference time and energy consumption with a\nmodel-based and data-driven method.

This alternative supervision is appealing\nbecause collecting complementary labels is generally cheaper and less\nlabor-intensive. Although most existing research in CLL emphasizes the\ndevelopment of novel loss functions, the potential of data augmentation in this\ndomain remains largely underexplored. In this work, we uncover that the\nwidely-used Mixup data augmentation technique is ineffective when directly\napplied to CLL. Through in-depth analysis, we identify that the\ncomplementary-label noise generated by Mixup negatively impacts the performance\nof CLL models. We then propose an improved technique called Intra-Cluster Mixup\n(ICM), which only synthesizes augmented data from nearby examples, to mitigate\nthe noise effect. ICM carries the benefits of encouraging complementary label\nsharing of nearby examples, and leads to substantial performance improvements\nacross synthetic and real-world labeled datasets. In particular, our wide\nspectrum of experimental results on both balanced and imbalanced CLL settings\njustifies the potential of ICM in allying with state-of-the-art CLL algorithms,\nachieving significant accuracy increases of 30% and 10% on MNIST and CIFAR\ndatasets, respectively."}
