Methods: Using data from the BRIGHTEN\nclinical trial, we evaluated intermediate (latent space) fusion for predicting\ndaily depressive symptoms (PHQ-2 scores).

However, accurately tracking tissue motion in B-mode ultrasound\nremains challenging due to speckle noise, low edge contrast, and out-of-plane\nmovement. These challenges complicate the task of tracking anatomical landmarks\nover time, which is essential for quantifying tissue dynamics in many clinical\nand research applications. This manuscript introduces DUSTrack (Deep learning\nand optical flow-based toolkit for UltraSound Tracking), a semi-automated\nframework for tracking arbitrary points in B-mode ultrasound videos. We combine\ndeep learning with optical flow to deliver high-quality and robust tracking\nacross diverse anatomical structures and motion patterns. The toolkit includes\na graphical user interface that streamlines the generation of high-quality\ntraining data and supports iterative model refinement. It also implements a\nnovel optical-flow-based filtering technique that reduces high-frequency\nframe-to-frame noise while preserving rapid tissue motion. DUSTrack\ndemonstrates superior accuracy compared to contemporary zero-shot point\ntrackers and performs on par with specialized methods, establishing its\npotential as a general and foundational tool for clinical and biomechanical\nresearch. We demonstrate DUSTrack's versatility through three use cases:\ncardiac wall motion tracking in echocardiograms, muscle deformation analysis\nduring reaching tasks, and fascicle tracking during ankle plantarflexion. As an\nopen-source solution, DUSTrack offers a powerful, flexible framework for point\ntracking to quantify tissue motion from ultrasound videos.

Conventional filtering algorithms often rely on\nthe selection of the filtering window, limiting their applicability in certain\nscenarios. To this end, we propose a novel Two-Dimensional Smoothing (TDS)\nalgorithm for the smoothing and filtering problem of two-dimensional sequences.\nTypically, the TDS algorithm does not require assumptions about the type of\nnoise distribution. It is simple and easy to implement compared to conventional\nfiltering methods, such as 2D adaptive Wiener filtering and Gaussian filtering.\nThe TDS algorithm can effectively extract the trend contained in the\ntwo-dimensional sequence and reduce the influence of noise on the data by\nadjusting only a single parameter. In this work, unlike existing algorithms\nthat depend on the filtering window, we introduce a loss function, where the\ntrend sequence is identified as the solution when this loss function takes a\nminimum value. Therefore, within the framework of the TDS algorithm, a general\ntwo-dimensional sequence can be innovatively decomposed into a trend sequence\nand a fluctuation sequence, in which the trend sequence contains the main\nfeatures of the sequence and the fluctuation sequence contains the detailed\nfeatures or noise interference of the sequence. To ensure the reliability of\nthe TDS algorithm, a crucial lemma is first established, indicating that the\ntrend sequence and fluctuation sequence obtained by the TDS algorithm are\nexistent and unique when the global smoothing parameter is determined. Three\nmodified algorithms are then proposed based on the TDS algorithm, with\ncorresponding lemmas and corollaries demonstrating their reliability. Finally,\nthe accuracy and effectiveness of the TDS algorithm are further verified\nthrough numerical simulations and image processing cases."}

In this paper, we introduce a\nhistogram-based RTT measurement feature for P4TG. It enables accurate analysis\nat line rate without sampling. Generally, histogram bins are modeled as ranges,\nand values are matched to a bin. Efficient packet matching in hardware is\ntypically achieved using ternary content addressable memory (TCAM).

Traditional real-time anomaly detection techniques often\nsuffer from excessive false positives due to their statistical sensitivity to\nhigh data variance and class imbalance. To address these limitations, recent\nresearch has explored modeling causal relationships among system components.\nHowever, prior work mainly focuses on offline causal graph-based approaches\nthat require static historical data and fail to generalize to real-time\nsettings. These methods are fundamentally constrained by: (1) their inability\nto adapt to dynamic shifts in data distribution without retraining, and (2) the\nrisk of catastrophic forgetting when lacking timely supervision in live\nsystems. To overcome these challenges, we propose INCADET, a novel framework\nfor incremental causal graph learning tailored to real-time cyberattack\ndetection. INCADET dynamically captures evolving system behavior by\nincrementally updating causal graphs across streaming time windows. The\nframework comprises three modules: 1) Early Symptom Detection: Detects\ntransitions in system status using divergence in edge-weight distributions\nacross sequential causal graphs. 2) Incremental Causal Graph Learning:\nLeverages experience replay and edge reinforcement to continually refine causal\nstructures while preserving prior knowledge. 3) Causal Graph Classification:\nEmploys Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to classify system status using the\nlearned causal graphs.

This paper presents an analysis of simple test-time\nscaling and finds that the scaling behavior is largely attributed to scaling\ndown by enforcing a maximum length. In contrast, fine-tuning on long CoT data\ndistilled from o1-like models has no significant impact on scaling behavior,\nand scaling up by appending \"Wait\" leads to inconsistencies, as the model may\noscillate between solutions. A key distinction exists between scaling down by\nenforcing a maximum length and scaling up test-time compute in o1-like models,\nsuch as DeepSeek-R1\\@.

Previous R1-Style methods mainly focus on mathematical reasoning\nand code intelligence. It is of great research significance to verify their\nadvantages on more general multimodal data. Chart is an important multimodal\ndata type with rich information, which brings important research challenges in\ncomplex reasoning. In this work, we introduce Chart-R1, a chart-domain\nvision-language model with reinforcement learning fine-tuning to enable complex\nchart reasoning. To support Chart-R1, we first propose a novel programmatic\ndata synthesis technology to generate high-quality step-by-step chart reasoning\ndata covering single- and multi-subcharts, which makes up for the lack of\nreasoning data in the chart domain. Then we develop a two-stage training\nstrategy: Chart-COT with step-by-step chain-of-thought supervision, and\nChart-RFT with numerically sensitive reinforcement fine-tuning. Chart-COT aims\nto decompose complex chart reasoning tasks into fine-grained, understandable\nsubtasks through step-by-step supervision, which lays a good foundation for\nimproving the reasoning level of reinforcement learning. Chart-RFT utilize the\ntypical group relative policy optimization strategy, in which a relatively soft\nreward is adopted for numerical response to emphasize the numerical sensitivity\nin the chart domain. We conduct extensive experiments on open-source benchmarks\nand self-built chart reasoning dataset (\\emph{i.e., ChartRQA}).

As a result, there\nis a lack of annotated data for model training. Diffusion models are commonly\nused for data augmentation, but the existing methods face two challenges.\nFirst, due to the high concealment of lesions, it is difficult for the model to\nlearn the features of the lesion area. This leads to the low generation quality\nof the lesion areas, thus limiting the quality of the generated images. Second,\nexisting methods can only generate images and cannot generate corresponding\nannotations, which restricts the usability of the generated images in\nsupervised training. In this work, we propose a paired image generation method.\nThe method does not require external conditions and can achieve the generation\nof paired images by training an extra diffusion guider for the conditional\ndiffusion model. During the experimental phase, we generated paired DBT slices\nand mass lesion masks. Then, we incorporated them into the supervised training\nprocess of the mass lesion segmentation task.

This study presents a theoretical and empirical\ninvestigation that provides fresh insights into the potential limits of RLVR.\nFirst, we offer a new theoretical perspective that RLVR is constrained by the\nbase model's support-unable to sample solutions with zero initial\nprobability-and operates as a conservative reweighting mechanism that may\nrestrict the discovery of entirely original solutions. We also identify an\nentropy-reward tradeoff: while RLVR reliably enhances precision, it may\nprogressively narrow exploration and potentially overlook correct yet\nunderrepresented solutions. Extensive empirical experiments validate that while\nRLVR consistently improves pass@1, the shrinkage of empirical support generally\noutweighs the expansion of empirical support under larger sampling budgets,\nfailing to recover correct answers that were previously accessible to the base\nmodel. Interestingly, we also observe that while RLVR sometimes increases\ntoken-level entropy, resulting in greater uncertainty at each generation step,\nanswer-level entropy declines, indicating that these seemingly more uncertain\npaths ultimately converge onto a smaller set of distinct answers. Taken\ntogether, these findings reveal potential limits of RLVR in extending reasoning\nhorizons. Breaking this invisible leash may require future algorithmic\ninnovations such as explicit exploration mechanisms or hybrid strategies that\nseed probability mass into underrepresented solution regions."}

Motivated by this, we assess current state-of-the-art generative\nmodels' capabilities in terms of text image generation and editing. We\nincorporate various typical optical character recognition (OCR) tasks into our\nevaluation and broaden the concept of text-based generation tasks into OCR\ngenerative tasks.

These\nproperties hinder semantic alignment and reduce interpretability. SDSC\naddresses this by quantifying structural agreement between temporal signals\nbased on the intersection of signed amplitudes, derived from the Dice\nSimilarity Coefficient (DSC).Although SDSC is defined as a structure-aware\nmetric, it can be used as a loss by subtracting from 1 and applying a\ndifferentiable approximation of the Heaviside function for gradient-based\noptimization. A hybrid loss formulation is also proposed to combine SDSC with\nMSE, improving stability and preserving amplitude where necessary.

This study presents a theoretical and empirical\ninvestigation that provides fresh insights into the potential limits of RLVR.\nFirst, we offer a new theoretical perspective that RLVR is constrained by the\nbase model's support-unable to sample solutions with zero initial\nprobability-and operates as a conservative reweighting mechanism that may\nrestrict the discovery of entirely original solutions. We also identify an\nentropy-reward tradeoff: while RLVR reliably enhances precision, it may\nprogressively narrow exploration and potentially overlook correct yet\nunderrepresented solutions. Extensive empirical experiments validate that while\nRLVR consistently improves pass@1, the shrinkage of empirical support generally\noutweighs the expansion of empirical support under larger sampling budgets,\nfailing to recover correct answers that were previously accessible to the base\nmodel.

By contrasting the output\ndistributions of the selected layer derived from the original input and\npure-text input, EVA extracts visual factual knowledge and proportionally\nincorporates it into the final layer to correct the output logits.

This endeavor is fueled\nby smartphones as well as technologies like industrial internet of things,\nextended reality (XR), and human-to-machine (H2M) collaborations for fostering\nindustrial and social revolutions like Industry 4.0/5.0 and Society 5.0. To\nensure an ideal immersive experience and avoid cyber-sickness for users in all\nthe aforementioned usage scenarios, it is typically challenging to synchronize\nXR content from a remote machine to a human collaborator according to their\nhead movements across a large geographic span in real-time over communication\nnetworks. Thus, we propose a novel H2M collaboration scheme where the human's\nhead movements are predicted ahead with highly accurate models like\nbidirectional long short-term memory networks to orient the machine's camera in\nadvance. We validate that XR frame size varies in accordance with the human's\nhead movements and predict the corresponding bandwidth requirements from the\nmachine's camera to propose a human-machine coordinated dynamic bandwidth\nallocation (HMC-DBA) scheme. Through extensive simulations, we show that\nend-to-end latency and jitter requirements of XR frames are satisfied with much\nlower bandwidth consumption over enterprise networks like\nFiber-To-The-Room-Business. Furthermore, we show that better efficiency in\nnetwork resource utilization is achieved by employing our proposed HMC-DBA over\nstate-of-the-art schemes."}

Viewing the low-rank\nrepresentation of the trainable weight matrices as a singular value\ndecomposition, we introduce an l_1 sparsity regularizer to the loss function,\nand tackle it with a proximal optimizer. The regularizer could be viewed as a\npenalty on the decomposition rank. Hence, its minimization enables to find\ntask-adapted ranks automatically. Our method is evaluated in a realistic\nfew-shot fine-tuning setting, where we compare it first to the standard LoRA\nand then to several other PEFT methods across two distinguishable tasks: base\norgans and novel organs. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the significant\nperformance improvements driven by our method, highlighting its efficiency and\nrobustness against suboptimal rank initialization.

This limitation arises from their reliance on appearance\nmatching, neglecting the human-like conceptual understanding of objects that\nenables robust identification across temporal dynamics. Motivated by this gap,\nwe propose Segment Concept (SeC), a concept-driven segmentation framework that\nshifts from conventional feature matching to the progressive construction and\nutilization of high-level, object-centric representations. SeC employs Large\nVision-Language Models (LVLMs) to integrate visual cues across diverse frames,\nconstructing robust conceptual priors. During inference, SeC forms a\ncomprehensive semantic representation of the target based on processed frames,\nrealizing robust segmentation of follow-up frames. Furthermore, SeC adaptively\nbalances LVLM-based semantic reasoning with enhanced feature matching,\ndynamically adjusting computational efforts based on scene complexity. To\nrigorously assess VOS methods in scenarios demanding high-level conceptual\nreasoning and robust semantic understanding, we introduce the Semantic Complex\nScenarios Video Object Segmentation benchmark (SeCVOS). SeCVOS comprises 160\nmanually annotated multi-scenario videos designed to challenge models with\nsubstantial appearance variations and dynamic scene transformations.

To address this, we introduce CXR-TFT, a novel multi-modal\nframework that integrates temporally sparse CXR imaging and radiology reports\nwith high-frequency clinical data, such as vital signs, laboratory values, and\nrespiratory flow sheets, to predict the trajectory of CXR findings in\ncritically ill patients. CXR-TFT leverages latent embeddings from a vision\nencoder that are temporally aligned with hourly clinical data through\ninterpolation. A transformer model is then trained to predict CXR embeddings at\neach hour, conditioned on previous embeddings and clinical measurements. In a\nretrospective study of 20,000 ICU patients, CXR-TFT demonstrated high accuracy\nin forecasting abnormal CXR findings up to 12 hours before they became\nradiographically evident.

However, real-world assurance of patient safety means that\nproviding individual diagnoses and treatment plans is considered a regulated\nactivity by licensed professionals. Furthermore, physicians commonly oversee\nother team members in such activities, including nurse practitioners (NPs) or\nphysician assistants/associates (PAs). Inspired by this, we propose a framework\nfor effective, asynchronous oversight of the Articulate Medical Intelligence\nExplorer (AMIE) AI system. We propose guardrailed-AMIE (g-AMIE), a multi-agent\nsystem that performs history taking within guardrails, abstaining from\nindividualized medical advice. Afterwards, g-AMIE conveys assessments to an\noverseeing primary care physician (PCP) in a clinician cockpit interface. The\nPCP provides oversight and retains accountability of the clinical decision.\nThis effectively decouples oversight from intake and can thus happen\nasynchronously. In a randomized, blinded virtual Objective Structured Clinical\nExamination (OSCE) of text consultations with asynchronous oversight, we\ncompared g-AMIE to NPs/PAs or a group of PCPs under the same guardrails. Across\n60 scenarios, g-AMIE outperformed both groups in performing high-quality\nintake, summarizing cases, and proposing diagnoses and management plans for the\noverseeing PCP to review. This resulted in higher quality composite decisions.\nPCP oversight of g-AMIE was also more time-efficient than standalone PCP\nconsultations in prior work. While our study does not replicate existing\nclinical practices and likely underestimates clinicians' capabilities, our\nresults demonstrate the promise of asynchronous oversight as a feasible\nparadigm for diagnostic AI systems to operate under expert human oversight for\nenhancing real-world care."}
