High-performance localization and sensing\nsystems are critical for both network efficiency and emerging intelligent\napplications.

Recent works have leveraged the\nspatial diversity of multiple input multiple output (MIMO) systems and the\nfrequency granularity of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)\nwaveforms to improve spatial resolution.

Over the next 200\nyears, they spread across Europe and luthiers of various royal courts, eager to\nexperiment with new techniques, created a highly diverse family of instruments.\nAround 1750, size standards were introduced to unify violin making for\norchestras and conservatories. Instruments that fell between two standards were\nthen reduced to a smaller size by luthiers. These reductions have an impact on\nseveral characteristics of violins, in particular on the contour lines, i.e.\nlines of constant altitude, which look more like a U for non reduced\ninstruments and a V for reduced ones. While such differences are observed by\nexperts, they have not been studied quantitatively.\n  This paper presents a method for classifying violins as reduced or\nnon-reduced based on their contour lines. We study a corpus of 25 instruments\nwhose 3D geometric meshes were acquired via photogrammetry. For each\ninstrument, we extract 10-20 contour lines regularly spaced every millimetre.\nEach line is fitted with a parabola-like curve (with an equation of the type y\n= alpha*abs(x)**beta) depending on two parameters, describing how open (beta)\nand how vertically stretched (alpha) the curve is. We compute additional\nfeatures from those parameters, using regressions and counting how many values\nfall under some threshold. We also deal with outliers and non equal numbers of\nlevels, and eventually obtain a numerical profile for each instrument.\n  We then apply classification methods to assess whether geometry alone can\npredict size reduction. We find that distinguishing between reduced and non\nreduced instruments is feasible to some degree, taking into account that a\nwhole spectrum of more or less transformed violins exists, for which it is more\ndifficult to quantify the reduction.

This paper introduces a\nconditional generative adversarial network (cGAN)-based framework for crafting\nstealthy adversarial attacks that evade IDS mechanisms. We first design a\nrobust multi-class IDS classifier trained on benign UAV telemetry and known\ncyber-attacks, including Denial of Service (DoS), false data injection (FDI),\nman-in-the-middle (MiTM), and replay attacks.

Moreover, the large size of foundation\nmodels makes them expensive and difficult to fine-tune on typically small\ndatasets for each task. We address this mismatch with MAPEX, a remote sensing\nfoundation model based on mixture-of-modality experts. MAPEX is pre-trained on\nmulti-modal remote sensing data with a novel modality-conditioned token routing\nmechanism that elicits modality-specific experts. To apply the model on a\nspecific task, we propose a modality aware pruning technique, which only\nretains experts specialized for the task modalities. This yields efficient\nmodality-specific models while simplifying fine-tuning and deployment for the\nmodalities of interest. We experimentally validate MAPEX on diverse remote\nsensing datasets and show strong performance compared to fully supervised\ntraining and state-of-the-art remote sensing foundation models.

To address this issue, we propose a class wise balancing\ndata replay method for FCIL (FedCBDR), which employs a global coordination\nmechanism for class-level memory construction and reweights the learning\nobjective to alleviate the aforementioned imbalances. Specifically, FedCBDR has\ntwo key components: 1) the global-perspective data replay module reconstructs\nglobal representations of prior task in a privacy-preserving manner, which then\nguides a class-aware and importance-sensitive sampling strategy to achieve\nbalanced replay; 2) Subsequently, to handle class imbalance across tasks, the\ntask aware temperature scaling module adaptively adjusts the temperature of\nlogits at both class and instance levels based on task dynamics, which reduces\nthe model's overconfidence in majority classes while enhancing its sensitivity\nto minority classes.

While these techniques already establish\nthat data from the training set can be reconstructed, they often rely on\nhigh-resources, excess to the training set as well as well-engineered and\ndesigned prompts.\n  In this work, we devise a new attack that requires low resources, assumes\nlittle to no access to the actual training set, and identifies, seemingly,\nbenign prompts that lead to potentially-risky image reconstruction. This\nhighlights the risk that images might even be reconstructed by an uninformed\nuser and unintentionally.

The comparison explicitly accounts for the\nlimited number of images that can be generated between planning and treatment\nsessions.\n  Methods: Digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) derived from planning\n4DCT scans of 31 patients were used to train the MP model; a 32nd patient was\nheld out for evaluation. PS models were trained using only the target patient's\nplanning data. Both models used 16 DRRs per input and predicted tumor motion\nover a 1-second horizon.

The proposed framework utilizes a comprehensive\ndataset curated from multiple publicly available sources, including TCGA, TCIA,\nand CPTAC. To process the diverse modalities, domain-specific models are\nemployed: CLAM, a ResNet50-based model, is used for histopathology WSIs, while\nMeD-3D, a pre-trained 3D-ResNet18 model, processes CT and MRI images. For\nstructured clinical and genomic data, a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is used.\nThese models are designed to extract deep feature embeddings from each\nmodality, which are then fused through an early and late integration\narchitecture. This fusion strategy enables the model to combine complementary\ninformation from multiple sources. Additionally, the framework is designed to\nhandle incomplete data, a common challenge in clinical settings, by enabling\ninference even when certain modalities are missing."}
