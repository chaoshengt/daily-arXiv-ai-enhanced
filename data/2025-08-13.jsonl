The vanilla diffusion model is trained on\nimages with no or less degradations, whereas BFR handles moderately to severely\ndegraded images.

Under\nstricter memory constraints, current replay-based methods are less effective.\nWhile ensemble methods improve adaptability (plasticity), they often struggle\nwith stability. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel approach that\nenhances ensemble learning through a Global Workspace Model (GWM)-a shared,\nimplicit memory that guides the learning of multiple student models.

While most existing\nresearch focuses on post-request waiting time prediction with knowing the\nmatched driver information, pre-request waiting time prediction (i.e., before\nsubmitting a ride request and without matching a driver) is also important, as\nit enables passengers to plan their trips more effectively and enhance the\nexperience of both passengers and drivers. However, it has not been fully\nstudied by existing works. In this paper, we take the first step toward\nunderstanding the predictability and explainability of pre-request passenger\nwaiting time in ridesharing systems. Particularly, we conduct an in-depth\ndata-driven study to investigate the impact of demand&supply dynamics on\npassenger waiting time. Based on this analysis and feature engineering, we\npropose FiXGBoost, a novel feature interaction-based XGBoost model designed to\npredict waiting time without knowing the assigned driver information. We\nfurther perform an importance analysis to quantify the contribution of each\nfactor.

We\npropose MonoPartNeRF, a novel framework for monocular dynamic human rendering\nthat ensures smooth transitions and robust occlusion recovery. First, we build\na bidirectional deformation model that combines rigid and non-rigid\ntransformations to establish a continuous, reversible mapping between\nobservation and canonical spaces. Sampling points are projected into a\nparameterized surface-time space (u, v, t) to better capture non-rigid motion.\nA consistency loss further suppresses deformation-induced artifacts and\ndiscontinuities.

This is combined with keyframe pose retrieval and interpolation, along\nthree orthogonal directions, to guide pose-aware feature sampling. A learnable\nappearance code is integrated via attention to model dynamic texture changes\neffectively.

While recent work has\nadvanced automated tumor segmentation and report generation, most efforts have\nfocused on preoperative data, with limited attention to postoperative imaging\nanalysis. This study introduces a comprehensive pipeline for standardized\npostsurtical reporting in CNS tumors. Using the Attention U-Net architecture,\nsegmentation models were trained for the preoperative (non-enhancing) tumor\ncore, postoperative contrast-enhancing residual tumor, and resection cavity.\nAdditionally, MR sequence classification and tumor type identification for\ncontrast-enhancing lesions were explored using the DenseNet architecture. The\nmodels were integrated into a reporting pipeline, following the RANO 2.0\nguidelines. Training was conducted on multicentric datasets comprising 2000 to\n7000 patients, using a 5-fold cross-validation. Evaluation included patient-,\nvoxel-, and object-wise metrics, with benchmarking against the latest BraTS\nchallenge results. The segmentation models achieved average voxel-wise Dice\nscores of 87%, 66%, 70%, and 77% for the tumor core, non-enhancing tumor core,\ncontrast-enhancing residual tumor, and resection cavity, respectively.\nClassification models reached 99.5% balanced accuracy in MR sequence\nclassification and 80% in tumor type classification. The pipeline presented in\nthis study enables robust, automated segmentation, MR sequence classification,\nand standardized report generation aligned with RANO 2.0 guidelines, enhancing\npostoperative evaluation and clinical decision-making. The proposed models and\nmethods were integrated into Raidionics, open-source software platform for CNS\ntumor analysis, now including a dedicated module for postsurgical analysis."}

Semi-supervised\ndomain adaptation (SSDA) is a major approach for addressing this issue,\nassuming that a fully labeled training set (source domain) is available, but\nthe test set (target domain) provides labels only for a small subset. In this\nstudy, we propose a novel two-step momentum encoder-utilized SSDA framework,\nMoSSDA, for multivariate time-series classification. Time series data are\nhighly sensitive to noise, and sequential dependencies cause domain shifts\nresulting in critical performance degradation. To obtain a robust,\ndomain-invariant and class-discriminative representation, MoSSDA employs a\ndomain-invariant encoder to learn features from both source and target domains.\nSubsequently, the learned features are fed to a mixup-enhanced positive\ncontrastive module consisting of an online momentum encoder. The final\nclassifier is trained with learned features that exhibit consistency and\ndiscriminability with limited labeled target domain data, without data\naugmentation. We applied a two-stage process by separating the gradient flow\nbetween the encoders and the classifier to obtain rich and complex\nrepresentations. Through extensive experiments on six diverse datasets, MoSSDA\nachieved state-of-the-art performance for three different backbones and various\nunlabeled ratios in the target domain data.

Under\nstricter memory constraints, current replay-based methods are less effective.\nWhile ensemble methods improve adaptability (plasticity), they often struggle\nwith stability. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel approach that\nenhances ensemble learning through a Global Workspace Model (GWM)-a shared,\nimplicit memory that guides the learning of multiple student models. The GWM is\nformed by fusing the parameters of all students within each training batch,\ncapturing the historical learning trajectory and serving as a dynamic anchor\nfor knowledge consolidation.

In addition, we introduce a multi-level collaborative distillation\nmechanism. This approach enforces peer-to-peer consistency among students and\npreserves historical knowledge by aligning each student with the GWM. As a\nresult, student models remain adaptable to new tasks while maintaining\npreviously learned knowledge, striking a better balance between stability and\nplasticity.

As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly common, AI's\nability to recognize and respond to human emotions is crucial for effective\nhuman-AI interactions.

However, the emotional intelligence of AI,\nparticularly multimodal large language models (MLLMs), remains largely\nunexplored. This study evaluates the emotion recognition abilities of MLLMs\nusing the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET) and its multiracial\ncounterpart (MRMET), and compares their performance against human participants.\nResults show that, on average, MLLMs outperform humans in accurately\nidentifying emotions across both tests.
